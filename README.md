**Spring Boot Profiles**

There are two profiles in this demo project.
First is "dev", second is "prod".

**Option 1 Via Java System Property:**

**1. Don't forget to pray before run this source code.**

**2. Run "mvn clean" to remove all files generated by the previous build.**

**3. Run "mvn compile" to compile the source code of the project.**

**4. Run "mvn package" to take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.**

**5. Run "java -Dspring.profiles.active=dev -jar target/spring-boot-profiles-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar". "dev" profile will be activated during application startup. You can switch to "prod" profile to activate the prod profile.**

**Option 2 Via Environment Variable:**

**1. Run "export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev"**

**2. Run "java -jar target/spring-boot-profiles-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"**

The option two will activate the profile dev.

If the system property is set, the environment variable SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE will be ignored.

**Option 3 Via property file:**

**1. Run "mvn package -Dspring.profiles.active=dev" to package profile dev.**

**2. java -Dspring.profiles.active=dev -jar target/spring-boot-profiles-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar**
