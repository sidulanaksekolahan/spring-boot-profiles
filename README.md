**Spring Boot Profiles**

There are two profiles in this demo project.
First is "dev", second is "prod".

**How to:**

**1. Don't forget to pray before run this source code.**

**2. Run "mvn clean" to remove all files generated by the previous build**

**3. Run "mvn compile" to compile the source code of the project.**

**4. Run "mvn package" to take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.**

**5. Run "java -Dspring.profiles.active=dev -jar target/spring-boot-profiles-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar". "dev" profile will be activated during application startup. You can switch to "prod" profile to activate the prod profile.**
